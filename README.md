# LSTM model Tutorials
This repo provides an introduction into Long-Short-Term Memory deep learning models.
The tutorials have the following learning objectives:
* Build a simple LSTM 
* Build an LSTM with feature inputs
* Become familiar with PyTorch
* Train models using GPU
* Use cloud hosted data (via AWS S3 -  streamflow-app-data bucket)
* Use and access .py scripts and functions to assist with model training, testing, and evaluation

Enjoy!
